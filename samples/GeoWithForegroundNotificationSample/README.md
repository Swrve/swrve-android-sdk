# Geo Sample Project
 
### SwrveGeoSDK
* See [GeoSample](../GeoSample/) for basics of implementing SwrveGeoSDK without a foreground notification.
* This sample uses a foreground notification for reliability and accuracy. For best results the content in the foreground notification should provide value to the user and updated periodically. See the [MainActivity](app/src/main/java/com/swrve/sdk/geo/sample/MainActivity.java) for example on how to update the foreground notification content.
