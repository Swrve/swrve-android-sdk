Release 4.1
-
Release Date: November 30, 2015

Android SDK release 4.1 is focused on the following:

* Custom events beginning with Swrve. or swrve. are now blocked and no longer sent by the SDK.

* It is now possible to turn off the Swrve SDK logs. For more information, see [How Do I Disable SDK Device Logging?](http://docs.swrve.com/faqs/sdk-integration/disable-sdk-device-logging/)

* New flag added to control the status bar when displaying in-app messages.
* Added new Material icon, big icon and accent support for notifications.
* Conversations now rotate if the screen width is more than 600 dp.
* The SDK now logs device region.
* Updated demo app to use Google Material Design.
* When building with Gradle there is no need to declare `INTERNET` / `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions as they will be pulled from the SDK’s `AndroidManifest.xml` automatically.
* Android source has been refactored into one module producing a core library flavor of the SDK and a Google library flavor of the SDK.

* Fixed issue with message rules so that resetting rules for QA users now only occurs once.

Release Date: January 21, 2015

Android SDK release 3.3.1 is focused on the following:

* The SDK now automatically captures and sends referrer information. For more information, see [User Acquisition Tracking Guide](http://docs.swrve.com/developer-documentation/technical-resources/user-acquisition-tracking-guide/).

Release 3.3
-
Release Date: November 11, 2014

Android SDK release 3.3 is focused on the following:

Release 3.2
-
Release Date: October 21, 2014

* Deprecated cross application install tracking.
* Added Crashlytics metadata if the app uses the Crashlytics SDK.
* Use http for in-app campaigns requests.

Release 3.1
-
Release Date: July 30, 2014

Android SDK release 3.1 is focused on the following:

* Google Cloud Messaging push notification integration has now been simplified. There is no longer any need to include the broadcast listener and service in the main app package; it is sufficient to target the broadcast listener and service provided with the SDK.
* Support for in-app message delivery at session start has been enhanced.
* The `android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE` and `android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE` permissions have been removed.

Android SDK release 3.1 includes the following bug fix:

* An issue whereby an attempt was made to send logging data to QA devices despite logging being disabled has been fixed.
* Google Cloud Messaging registration ids are also obtained from the Broadcast Receiver to workaround Google Play bugs.

Release 3.0.1
-
Release Date: May 27, 2014

Android SDK release 3.0.1 includes the following bug fixes:

* An error whereby an exception on the UI listener could cause an app to crash has been corrected.
* An issue whereby `SwrveIAPRewards` caused a crash on unsupported Android versions (Java 1.5) has been corrected.

Release 3.0
-
Release Date: May 15, 2014

Android SDK release 3.0 is focused on the following:

* Real-time targeting enhancements – Swrve now automatically downloads user resources and campaign messages and keeps them up to date in near real-time during each session in order to reflect the latest segment membership. This is useful for time-sensitive A/B tests and messaging campaigns.
* The Android SDK now includes separate JAR files for the plain vanilla SDK (`swrvesdk.jar`) and the Google Play Android SDK (`swrvegoogle.sdk`) respectively. This separation has been made because the Google Play SDK requires the use of Google external libraries that may not work or may prevent the app from being submitted in different app stores. No code changes are required to use either option, except when using either IAP Google Play or Google Cloud Messaging push notifications.
* Functions which controlled whether and how often events were automatically sent to Swrve have been removed as Swrve now sends events automatically as part of the real-time targeting feature.
* Support for multiple activities is now available.
* A dialog listener is now available to control in-app message dialogs.
* It is now possible to select the minimum sample size that is used to load in-app message images.
* It is now possible to change the image cache folder.

Android SDK release 3.0 includes the following bug fixes:

* A patch for a HTTP Google bug has been implemented.
* An issue with Google app store linking for in-app messages has been fixed.
* A potential race condition whereby SQLite connections could be used after the SDK was destroyed has been fixed.

Release 2.10.1
-
Release Date: April 3, 2014

An issue with push notification initialization has been fixed. This issue only affects customers using Swrve’s push notification functionality.

Release 2.10
-
Release Date: April 1, 2014

Android SDK release 2.10 is focused on the following:

* Processing of the Install and Deep Link in-app message actions has been simplified.
* Registration of QA devices has been simplified.
* All events can now act as triggers for in-app messages and push notifications.
* The SDK now runs on Android 2.2.x version devices (such as API Level 8 and Froyo) and it gracefully does nothing (that is, it does not send any data or campaigns; it acts as a dummy SDK).

Android SDK release 2.10 includes the following bug fixes:

* In-app messaging orientation issues have been fixed.
* The SDK now sets a client_time timestamp in every event in each batch.

Release 2.9
-
Release Date: March 4, 2014

Android SDK release 2.9 is focused on the following:

* Push notifications are now supported for Android devices.
* The automatic campaign event is now changed to `swrve.messages_downloaded`.
* Campaign, user resources and saved events signing processes have been added.

Release 2.8
-
Android SDK release 2.8 is focused on Swrve’s redesigned in-app messaging functionality. It includes the following:

* Swrve’s in-app message format rules are now enforced.

* For information about upgrading to Android SDK 2.8, see Swrve Android SDK Upgrade Guide.

### Release 2.8 Push Beta

This SDK release contains the same updates as the 2.8 release but also enables you to send push notifications to Android devices on the Google Play app store. If you're interested in Beta testing push notifications, contact your Swrve account manager for more information.

Release 2.7.1
-
Android SDK release 2.7.1 fixes a bug which caused events to be sent to Swrve in a different order than they were queued by your app. This caused funnel reporting to be incorrect for android users in some cases. If you are using funnels in your dashboard you should upgrade to this SDK.

Release 2.7
-
Android SDK release 2.7 is focused on the auto-generation of user IDs and the unification of the in-app messaging and analytics SDKs. It includes the following:

* User IDs are now auto-generated (though they can be overwritten).
